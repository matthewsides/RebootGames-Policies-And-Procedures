#### [4] RISKS

####  Physical Risks

Physical risks pertain to; fires, floods, natural disasters, burglary, theft, vandalism and terrorism. Physical security is the protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks and data from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise, agency or institution. 

####  Internal 

An internal risk is a risk that arises from the events taking place within a organistion.Internal risks are usually forecasted with some reliablity thus not likely to appear often. Internal risks may be linked to three other risk factors; Human, Physical and Technological (defined in this documentation).


####  External 

External risks are those that arise from events outside of the organization's control. These risks can offer negative and/or positive benefits. Organizations cannot influence the likelihood of these risk events, but can reduce the cost of an impact.

#### Software Based

Software risk encompasses the probability of occurrence for uncertain events and their potential for loss within an organization.As organizations continue to implement more applications across a multiple technology, multi-tiered environment the risks that sofware heralds increase.

#### Social engineering

Social engineering refers to the exploitation of human psychological and people's inherent trust, manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information relating to an organisation.The natural inclination to trust is usually the target of exploitation thus it is important to be aware of who and what to trust.Knowing when, and when not to, to take a person at their word; when to trust that the person in communication is indeed the person stated or thought to be; when to trust that a website is or isn’t legitimate; when to trust that the person on the phone is or isn’t legitimate; when providing information is or isn’t a good idea.

#### Human Risk

Human Risk is essentially a broad term for purposeful or accidental  events caused by a human that may affect an organisation's operational status and financial results. This encompassess all aspects or risk factors (internal, external, software based, social engineering, physical, generally all stem from a humans mistakes or malicious intentions).

#### [5] POLICIES 

#### Data Protection Policy 

##### Policy statement and objectives

The objectives of this Data Protection Policy are to ensure that Reboot games employees are informed about, and comply with, their obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (“the GDPR”) and other data protection legislations.

Reboot games has a right to inform their employees as to how their personal information is handled. During the course of our activities we will Process personal information about a number of different groups of people and we recognise that we need to treat it in an appropriate and lawful manner.

The type of information that we may handle include details of job applicants, current, past and prospective employees and other individuals that we communicate with. The information, which may be held on paper or on a computer or other media, is subject to certain legal safeguards specified in the GDPR and other legislation. The GDPR imposes restrictions on how we may use that information.

This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract and may be amended at any time. Any breach of this policy by members of staff will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action and serious breaches may result in dismissal. Breach of the GDPR may expose Reboot Games to enforcement action by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), including the risk of fines. Furthermore, certain breaches of the Act can give rise to personal criminal liability for the companys employees. At the very least, a breach of the GDPR could damage the companys reputation and have serious consequences for Reboot games and our stakeholders.

##### Data protection principles


#### [6]  PROCEDURES

#### Data Protection Procedures

Anyone processing Personal Data must comply with the enforceable principles of good
practice. These provide that Personal Data must be:
5.1.1 processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;
5.1.2 collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further
processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further
processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be
incompatible with the initial purposes;
5.1.3 adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes
for which they are processed;
5.1.4 accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be
taken to ensure that Personal Data that are inaccurate, having regard to the
purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;
5.1.5 kept in a form which permits identification of Data Subjects for no longer than is
necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data are processed;
Personal Data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the Personal Data
will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation
of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR
in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and
5.1.6 Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the Personal Data,
including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against
accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or
organisational measures.
5.2 Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner
5.2.1 The GDPR is intended not to prevent the processing of Personal Data, but to
ensure that it is done fairly and without adversely affecting the rights of the Data
Subject. The Data Subject must be told who the Data Controller is (in this case 
6
the Schools), who the Data Controller’s representative is (in this case the DPO),
the purpose for which the data is to be Processed by us, and the identities of
anyone to whom the Data may be disclosed or transferred.
5.2.2 For Personal Data to be processed lawfully, certain conditions have to be met.
These may include:
5.2.2.1 where we have the Consent of the Data Subject;
5.2.2.2 where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation;
5.2.2.3 where processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the
Data Subject or another person;
5.2.2.4 where it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in
the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
controller.
5.2.3 Personal data may only be processed for the specific purposes notified to the
Data Subject when the data was first collected, or for any other purposes
specifically permitted by the Act. This means that Personal Data must not be
collected for one purpose and then used for another. If it becomes necessary to
change the purpose for which the data is processed, the Data Subject must be
informed of the new purpose before any processing occurs.
