#### [4] RISKS

####  Physical Risks

Physical risks pertain to; fires, floods, natural disasters, burglary, theft, vandalism and terrorism. Physical security is the protection of personnel, hardware, software, networks and data from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise, agency or institution. 

####  Internal 

An internal risk is a risk that arises from the events taking place within a organistion.Internal risks are usually forecasted with some reliablity thus not likely to appear often. Internal risks may be linked to three other risk factors; Human, Physical and Technological (defined in this documentation).


####  External 

External risks are those that arise from events outside of the organization's control. These risks can offer negative and/or positive benefits. Organizations cannot influence the likelihood of these risk events, but can reduce the cost of an impact.

#### Software Based

Software risk encompasses the probability of occurrence for uncertain events and their potential for loss within an organization.As organizations continue to implement more applications across a multiple technology, multi-tiered environment the risks that sofware heralds increase.

#### Social engineering

Social engineering refers to the exploitation of human psychological and people's inherent trust, manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information relating to an organisation.The natural inclination to trust is usually the target of exploitation thus it is important to be aware of who and what to trust.Knowing when, and when not to, to take a person at their word; when to trust that the person in communication is indeed the person stated or thought to be; when to trust that a website is or isn’t legitimate; when to trust that the person on the phone is or isn’t legitimate; when providing information is or isn’t a good idea.

#### Human Risk

Human Risk is essentially a broad term for purposeful or accidental  events caused by a human that may affect an organisation's operational status and financial results. This encompassess all aspects or risk factors (internal, external, software based, social engineering, physical, generally all stem from a humans mistakes or malicious intentions).


 #### [5] ISO STANDARDS
 
The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations. The organisation primarly creates and promotes proprietary, industrial and commercial standards. Theses standards are essentially guidelines for products or systems to ensure safety, efficiency and quality.

#### ISO 31000

ISO 31000 is the international standard relating to risk management, providing comprehensive principles and guidelines, this standard helps organizations with their risk analysis and risk assessments. ISO 31000:2018 is one of the most recent and notable guidelines that comes under ISO 31000 providing principles, framework and a process for managing risk. The structure and guidelines can be applied to any organization regardless of its size, activity or sector.
      
#### [6] POLICIES 

#### Data Protection Policy 

##### Policy statement and objectives

The objectives of this Data Protection Policy are to ensure that Reboot games employees are informed about, and comply with, their obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (“the GDPR”) and other data protection legislations.

Reboot games has a right to inform their employees as to how their personal information is handled. During the course of our activities we will Process personal information about a number of different groups of people and we recognise that we need to treat it in an appropriate and lawful manner.

The type of information that we may handle include details of job applicants, current, past and prospective employees and other individuals that we communicate with. The information, which may be held on paper or on a computer or other media, is subject to certain legal safeguards specified in the GDPR and other legislation. The GDPR imposes restrictions on how we may use that information.

This policy does not form part of any employee’s contract and may be amended at any time. Any breach of this policy by members of staff will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action and serious breaches may result in dismissal. Breach of the GDPR may expose Reboot Games to enforcement action by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), including the risk of fines. Furthermore, certain breaches of the Act can give rise to personal criminal liability for the companys employees. At the very least, a breach of the GDPR could damage the companys reputation and have serious consequences for Reboot games and our stakeholders.

##### Processing in line with Data Subjects’ rights

Data Subjects have rights when it comes to how we handle their Personal Data. These include rights to:

• Withdraw Consent to Processing at any time;

• Receive certain information about the Data Controller’s Processing activities;

• Request access to their Personal Data that we hold;

• Prevent our use of their Personal Data for direct marketing purposes;

• Ask us to erase Personal Data if it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or Processed or to rectify inaccurate data or to complete incomplete data;

•Restrict Processing in specific circumstances;

•Challenge Processing which has been justified on the basis of our legitimate interests or in the public interest;

• Request a copy of an agreement under which Personal Data is transferred outside of the EEA;

• Object to decisions based solely on Automated Processing, including profiling (Automated Decision Making);

•Prevent Processing that is likely to cause damage or distress to the Data Subject or anyone else;

•Be notified of a Personal Data Breach which is likely to result in high risk to their rights and freedoms;

• Make a complaint to the supervisory authority (the ICO); and in limited circumstances, receive or ask for their Personal Data to be transferred to a third party in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format.

• We are required to verify the identity of an individual requesting data under any of the rights listed above. Members of staff should not allow third parties to persuade them into disclosing Personal Data without proper authorisation.

#### [7]  PROCEDURES

#### Data Protection Procedures

• When data is stored on paper, it will be kept in a secure place where unauthorised people cannot see it. The following procedures also apply to data that is usually stored electronically but has been printed out for some reason:

• When not required, the paper or files will be kept in a lock drawer, cupboard or filing cabinet;

• Employees will make sure paper and printouts are not left where unauthorised people can see them, like on a printer;

• Data printouts will be shredded and disposed of securely when no longer required.

• When data is stored electronically, it must be protected from unauthorised access, accidental deletion and malicious hacking attempts:

• Data will be protected by a strong password that is changed regularly and never shared between employees;

• If data is stored on removable media (like a CD or DVD), these will be kept locked away securely when not being used;

• Data will only be stored on a designated drive and server, and will only be uploaded to an approved cloud computing service when if required;

• The secure server is sited in a secure location away from general office space;

• Data is backed up daily. Backup tests are completed once a week;

• Data will not be saved directly to laptops or other media devices like a tablet or smart phone;

• Our server and computers containing data are protected by approved security software and a firewall.

#### Security Awareness Procedures

• All suspicious activity should be immediately reported to the reception staff in the first instance (who will contact appropriate security).

•  Personal valuables should be locked away, placed out of sight or kept on the person. Personal property should never be left unattended.

• Offices must be locked upon leaving, with windows closed and locked

•  Laptops should not be left unattended and must be locked out of sight when not in use, particularly overnight. In open areas, laptops should be either secured to the desk with a steel enclosure or security cable or locked away when not in use in a secure cabinet

•  Ground-floor windows (and curtains or blinds) should be closed at dusk and lights should be turned off when leaving.

#### Identity Cards

All employees are issued with Identification cards (ID) , which is used for library, identity, student registration and access control. All employees are eligible for such ID cards in order to gain access past the barriers to the inner grounds (outer area is open to the public), however only those whom require or are of a certain access level can open all rooms (card restrictions based on level).  ID cards are valid for the duration of the individual’s contract. These cards should be regarded in security terms as the same as a key and remain the property of Reboot Games. Cardholders must safeguard their card and report any loss to the company. ID cards are not transferable, and holders must not loan their card to other persons for means of access or for any other purpose. Disciplinary action may be taken by the company for the misuse of the organisations cards.

#### Remote Access

Only trusted machines, not public kiosk machines, should be used to connect to Reboot games network remotely.

Staff using personal computers (as opposed to the computers on company grounds) to access Reboot Games systems must protect Reboots data by: 

• Ensuring that the machine is protected by a firewall, anti-virus software and the installation of security updates;


#### Network Security

The security of Reboot Games network is integral to the protection of all data held allows the abidement of certain legistlations ensuring the company is not violating any laws set by the goverment or an external governing body. The below are possibilities that could be explored to ensure that the network is secure;

##### DMZ

A Demilitarized Zone is a segment of a network isolated from the rest for the purpose of public use. Further delving into the application for Reboot Games network, the local intranet could be made unknown to the servers by putting the servers on another network segment. This would essentially improve the networks security as the likelyhood of foreign access (attacks) would decrease as the two servers store no information about the internal network, and any connections to Web services are seen as coming from just another IP address that has been allotted from the ISP. 

This would mean that if one server is compromised, the attacker will still have trouble accessing the local network as the only accessibility to the LAN would stil be through the hardware firewall/router. Thus nullifying the use of the servers to access the LAN as the attackers would still have to go through the same obstacles as if they were attempting direct access (from their own systems),leaving no back alleys to Reboots private data.


##### Static IP

An IP address is an unique identifier used for devices accross networks, the address for a device is dynamic meaning that it changes after reseting the device/system. A Static IP address however is fixed to the connection and device not changing.

The benefits of Reboot games network utilising a static IP address is that physical access to a computer would be required to alter the IP address. Where as if a Dynamic IP(DHCP) is configured in a PC, any User using the network could create a fake DHCP Server in the Network using their own  PC so that when an IP Request is sent the fake DHCP server can reply. Thus allocating the PC their IP as the default gateway and DNS server address meaning that it is possible to spoof ingoing packages, capable in principle of making any changes desired. 

Though if the appropriate practices are followed, firewalls, security, ect. are up to date it should not necessary make a difference in whether a Static or Dynamic IP address is used. 

##### NAT


#### [8] RESPONSIBILITIES	

All employees whether current or past are expected to keep all data confidental and have a responsibility to protect any data that has not been deemed or allowed for public access by either the data holder or whom the data may concern. Though specific roles have been delegated out in order to ensure the proper use of data and that legislations are abided by and followed.

#### Data Protection Officer

The Data Protection Officer (the “DPO”) is responsible for ensuring Reboot Games is compliant with the GDPR and with this policy.Any questions or concerns about the operation of this policy should be referred in the first instance to the DPO.

The DPO will play a major role in embedding essential aspects of the GDPR into the company, from ensuring the data protection principles are respected to preserving data subject rights, recording data processing activities and ensuring the security of
processing.

The DPO should be involved, in a timely manner, in all issues relating to the protection of personal data. To do this, the GDPR requires that DPOs are provided with the necessary support and resources to enable the DPO to effectively carry out their tasks. Factors that
should be considered include the following:

•senior management support;

•time for DPOs to fulfil their duties;

•adequate financial resources, infrastructure (premises, facilities and equipment) and staff where appropriate;

•official communication of the designation of the DPO to make known existence and function within the organisation;

•access to other services, such as HR, IT and security, who should provide support to the DPO;

•continuous training so that DPOs can stay up to date with regard to data protection developments;

•where a DPO team is deemed necessary, a clear infrastructure detailing roles and responsibilities of each team member;

•whether the company should give the DPO access to external legal advice to advise the DPO on their responsibilities under this Data Protection Policy.

•The DPO is responsible for ensuring that the organisations processing operations adequately safeguard Personal Data, in line with legal requirements. This means that the governance structure within the organisation must ensure the independence of the DPO.

• Reboot Games will ensure that the DPO does not receive instructions in respect of the carrying out of their tasks, which means that the DPO must not be instructed how to deal with a matter, such as how to investigate a complaint or what result should be achieved.

• Further, the DPO should report directly to the highest management level (ensures that HML are made aware of the pertinent data protection issues).

• A DPO appointed internally by Reboot Games is permitted to undertake other tasks and duties for the organisation, but these must not result in a conflict of interests with his or her role as DPO. It follows that any conflict of interests between the individual's role as DPO and other roles the individual may have within the organisation impinge on the DPO's ability to remain independent.

• In order to avoid conflicts the DPO cannot hold another position within the organisation that involves determining the purposes and means of processing personal data.
